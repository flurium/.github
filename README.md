Ideas for products: 

## Grids

As Andrew Tate said: 
> it's not possible to live without grids in the modern world, so you must be on as many grids as possible.

Componets of grids:
- Email sending
- Payments

We will concentrate on email sending, but if it works we will think about payments.
Developers and companies will be unstoppable, because if 1 service stops or bans you or limit is reached Grids will use another one.
Grids keep your limits to avoid making requests to services where limits are reached.
